## Introduction to Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)

Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a set of IEEE standards that extend standard Ethernet to support real-time, deterministic communication. It enables guaranteed bandwidth, low latency, and synchronization for critical applications.

One of the first implementations of TSN is **Audio Video Bridging (AVB)**, designed for professional audio/video transport. AVB provides features such as:

- Stream reservation for guaranteed bandwidth
- Precise time synchronization using gPTP (802.1AS)
- Low-latency forwarding with credit-based traffic shaping (802.1Qav)
- Seamless stream management with MSRP (802.1Qat)

## Milan: The ProAV Flavor of AVB

Milan is a ProAV-specific AVB solution developed by the Avnu Alliance. It ensures interoperability by defining a **deterministic** and **fully standardized** network transport layer for professional audio and video devices.

This knowledge base explores Milan in detail, helping engineers and integrators understand its benefits and implementation.

## **MSRP Cheatsheet â€“ Bandwidth Calculation Made Easy**

To help users calculate AVB bandwidth requirements quickly, weâ€™ve created an MSRP (Multiple Stream Reservation Protocol) **cheatsheet**.
