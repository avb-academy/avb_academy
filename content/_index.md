## Introduction to Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)

Time-Sensitive Networking ({{< tooltip "TSN">}}) is a set of {{< tooltip "IEEE">}} standards that extend standard Ethernet to support real-time, deterministic communication. It enables guaranteed bandwidth, low latency, and synchronization for critical applications.

One of the first implementations of {{< tooltip "TSN">}} is {{< tooltip "AVB" >}}, designed for professional audio/video transport. {{< tooltip "AVB">}} provides features such as:

- Stream reservation for guaranteed bandwidth
- Precise time synchronization using {{< tooltip "gPTP">}}
- Low-latency forwarding with credit-based traffic shaping
- Seamless stream management with {{< tooltip "MSRP">}}
