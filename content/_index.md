# Introduction

You are looking for information about the Milan protocol, and someone mentioned that you can find it at the AVB Academy. However, you might be wondering: why AVB Academy when you are interested in Milan? Before answering that question, let us take a step back. What forms the foundation of Milan?

## Introduction to Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)

Time-Sensitive Networking ({{< tooltip "TSN">}}) is a set of {{< tooltip "IEEE">}} standards that extend standard Ethernet to support real-time, deterministic communication. It enables guaranteed bandwidth, low latency, and synchronization for critical applications.

One of the first implementations of {{< tooltip "TSN">}} is {{< tooltip "AVB" >}}, designed for professional audio/video transport. {{< tooltip "AVB">}} provides features such as:

- Stream reservation for guaranteed bandwidth
- Precise time synchronization using {{< tooltip "gPTP">}}
- Low-latency forwarding with credit-based traffic shaping
- Seamless stream management with {{< tooltip "MSRP">}}

## Milan: The ProAV Flavor of AVB

{{< tooltip "Milan">}} is a ProAV-specific {{< tooltip "AVB">}} solution developed by the {{< tooltip "Avnu Alliance">}}. It ensures interoperability by defining a **deterministic** and **fully standardized** network transport layer for professional audio and video devices.

This knowledge base explores {{< tooltip "Milan">}} in detail, helping engineers and integrators understand its benefits and implementation.
