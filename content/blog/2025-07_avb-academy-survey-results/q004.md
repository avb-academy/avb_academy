<div class="text-image-container">
  <div class="text">

The responses, as shown in [Fig. 6](#fig-used-milan-before), are nearly evenly split:

- Yes: 35  
- Not yet, but I am interested: 34  
- No, and I am not interested: 1

  </div>
</div>

### Interpretation

The responses reflect a high level of interest in AVB/Milan. With half of the participants having prior experience (see [Q03: What is your experience with audio networking](q003.md)) and nearly all others eager to learn more, the user base has clear potential for growth. Only one participant indicated no interest, representing an outlier in an otherwise highly engaged audience.

This creates an ideal opportunity to launch AVB Academy as a resource tailored to both newcomers and experienced professionals.
