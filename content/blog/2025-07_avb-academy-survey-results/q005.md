### Interpretation

Troubleshooting networks under time pressure emerged as the most common challenge, highlighting the need for intuitive tools and strong preparation. Nearly as many participants pointed to difficulties in integrating protocols, finding reliable resources, and configuring switches.

These findings indicate a clear demand for better training, improved documentation, and more user-friendly workflows in the audio networking field.
