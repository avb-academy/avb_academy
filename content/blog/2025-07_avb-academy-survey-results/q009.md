### Interpretation

The majority of participants (56) reported that they would access the AVB Academy via both desktop and mobile devices, underscoring the importance of a responsive, cross-platform user experience. This suggests that learners value flexibility and accessibility across different contexts, from office environments to on-the-go situations.

A significant subset (16 participants) prefers mostly mobile access, reinforcing the need for mobile-first usability and streamlined navigation on smaller screens.

Thirteen participants expressed interest in a PDF version, highlighting demand for offline access or printable materials, which can be valuable for reference during professional work or training.

Only nine participants indicated a preference for mostly desktop access, making it the least common single-mode choice. Nevertheless, desktop compatibility remains crucial, particularly for more detailed reading, editing, or technical activities.

These findings emphasize the necessity of:

- Fully responsive web design,  
- Mobile-first layout considerations,  
- And offering downloadable PDF content for offline use.
