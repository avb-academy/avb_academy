### Interpretation

The responses show a strong potential for community engagement. A total of 48 participants stated they would be willing to contribute their knowledge or experience, while an additional 20 indicated they might do so. This suggests a solid foundation for building a contributor-driven platform, with a large portion of the audience open to sharing insights. This could happen either regularly or occasionally.

Only 3 participants said they would not contribute, indicating that the overwhelming majority values the idea of collaborative knowledge-building.

To support this interest, the AVB Academy should provide clear and accessible pathways for contribution. Examples include anonymous submissions, a streamlined editorial review process, and lightweight content formats. Even those who do not actively contribute may still benefit from and engage with a community-driven knowledge base, further reinforcing the platformâ€™s collaborative spirit.
