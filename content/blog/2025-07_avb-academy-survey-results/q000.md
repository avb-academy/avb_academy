## Interpretation

The distribution of responses by preferred language indicates that the AVB Academy survey primarily reached German- and English-speaking audiences. These two groups together accounted for more than 85% of all participants, with German slightly ahead of English. In comparison, participation from French and Spanish speakers was limited.

This imbalance can largely be attributed to the outreach strategy of the project. As a privately initiated initiative led by a single author, promotional efforts focused on the author's personal LinkedIn and Facebook networks (primarily English and German contacts), as well as a German speaking [PA-Forum](https://paforum.de/forum/). The latter triggered a noticeable increase in German-language submissions, demonstrating that even a single targeted post within the right community can significantly influence participation.

The low response rate from French- and Spanish-speaking participants highlights an opportunity for broader engagement. Future outreach in these language communities. For example through translated announcements, localized landing pages, or partnerships with relevant forums and organizationsâ€”could help diversify the respondent base and enhance the inclusiveness of the AVB Academy.
