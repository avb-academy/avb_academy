### Interpretation

Most participants prefer to begin with a high-level explanation, followed by a step-by-step guide. This option was selected by 59 respondents, making it the most common approach. The result highlights a preference for understanding the broader context before engaging with detailed procedures.

Video tutorials were chosen by 28 participants, indicating a significant portion of the audience favors audiovisual content over written materials.

Step-by-step guides without a high-level introduction were selected by 20 participants. This suggests a smaller group prefers to dive directly into the practical aspects without needing conceptual framing in advance.
