### Interpretation

The majority of participants (53) would prefer to ask questions publicly, provided their identity remains anonymous. This highlights a desire for shared learning opportunities, balanced with the need for privacy and psychological safety. It suggests that participants are more likely to engage in public discussions if anonymity is ensured.

A smaller group (16 participants) prefers to ask questions privately, which may reflect a need for direct, personal supportâ€”particularly for sensitive or context-specific issues.

Only 2 participants stated they would not ask questions at all, possibly indicating a preference for independent learning or limited engagement.

These results suggest that offering both an anonymous public Q&A option and a private support channel would best accommodate user preferences and foster participation in the AVB Academy.
