The responses in the "Other" category can mostly be aligned with the existing options, except for mentions of "Sound Art" and "Beginner", which indicate unique or early-stage engagement.

## Interpretation

The survey results show that participants are primarily active in domains where the Milan AVB protocol is both relevant and beneficial. These include Live Concerts, Corporate Events, and Theatrical Productions. These event types typically demand robust, low-latency audio networking. This is an area where AVB and Milan technologies provide clear advantages.

It is encouraging to see interest in the Installed Systems category as well. Although these environments often rely on legacy or non-AVB-ready infrastructure, the responses suggest a growing awareness of Milan AVB in fixed installations and a potential shift toward broader adoption in this area.
