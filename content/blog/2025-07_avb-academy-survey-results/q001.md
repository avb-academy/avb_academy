## Interpretation

Initial assumptions about the potential user base of the AVB Academy were too narrowly focused on field professionals, mainly sound engineers in specialized roles such as System Technicians or FOH Engineers. However, the survey revealed that nearly 10% of participants work in research and development, and another 10% in management. These groups were not anticipated during the survey design. The presence of educators and trainers also indicates a broader interest in the material.

These insights highlight the importance of structuring AVB Academy content to offer both accessible, high-level explanations of core concepts and more detailed technical material. This dual approach can better support the varied needs of practitioners, developers, managers, and educators.
