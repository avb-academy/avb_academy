## Interpretation

The responses indicate a strong foundation in audio networking among participants. Nearly two-thirds rate themselves as advanced, suggesting that audio networking has become a routine part of professional practice rather than a niche skill.

This widespread expertise may reflect the increasing availability of high-quality training resources, particularly for Layer 3 (AoIP) technologies, offered by a range of manufacturers, institutions, and educators.
