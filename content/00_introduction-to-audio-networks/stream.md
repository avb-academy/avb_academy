A Stream in the context of Milan refers to a unidirectional transmission of data from a source to one or more destinations within a network. Streams are categorized based on the type of data they carry, such as Clock Streams for synchronization or Audio Streams for media transport.

In Milan, Streams are multicast by default. This allows one source to send data to many receivers without using extra network bandwidth for each additional receiver. Moreover, Milan defines Stream formats that ensure interoperability, precise synchronization, and reliable delivery of data across Milan certified devices.
