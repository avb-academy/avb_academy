A Stream in the context of Milan refers to a unidirectional transmission of data from a source to one or more destinations within a network. Streams are categorized based on the type of data they carry, such as Clock Streams for synchronization or Audio Streams for media transport.

In Milan, Streams are designed to be multicast by default, allowing them to be sent to multiple destinations without consuming additional network bandwidth each time they are sent to an additional destination. Moreover, Milan defines Stream formats that ensure interoperability, precise synchronization, and reliable delivery of data across Milan certified devices.
