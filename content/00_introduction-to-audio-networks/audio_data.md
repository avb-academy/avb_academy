The audio data in a network is the digital representation of the analog sound. Typically, the audio data is sent through a mixing console before reaching the speakers. Audio data is essential for the audience, but it depends on accurate clocking. Without proper sync, audio cannot be played out correctly.

In concert situations, audio data must be played out in the very close future after it is captured, meeting strict real-time demands. Any loss of audio data can cause distortion, making the sound unpleasant for the audience.
