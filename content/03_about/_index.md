Milan needs users, and users need Milan—even if they don’t realize it yet. This page was created simply because no one else had done it. While companies with Milan-enabled products do a great job educating users about their specific implementations, I’ve always felt the need for an independent, unbranded knowledge base that focuses on the fundamentals of this powerful technology.

I’ve been exploring AVB since 2016, and even now, finding clear, basic information beyond branded workshops or the IEEE specification remains a challenge. To this day, no one has attempted to bridge this gap—until now.
