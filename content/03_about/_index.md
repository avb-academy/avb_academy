Milan needs users, and users need Milan—even if they do not realize it yet. 

This page was created simply because it had not been done before. While companies with Milan-enabled products do a great job educating users about their specific implementations, an independent, unbranded knowledge base focusing on the fundamentals of this powerful technology has long been missing.

Clear, basic information beyond branded workshops or the IEEE specification remains difficult to find. To this day, no one has attempted to bridge this gap—until now.
