Milan needs users, and users need Milan—even if they do not realize it yet. This page was created simply because no one else had done it. While companies with Milan-enabled products do a great job educating users about their specific implementations, I have always felt the need for an independent, unbranded knowledge base that focuses on the fundamentals of this powerful technology.

I have been exploring AVB since 2016, and even now, finding clear, basic information beyond branded workshops or the IEEE specification remains a challenge. To this day, no one has attempted to bridge this gap—until now.
