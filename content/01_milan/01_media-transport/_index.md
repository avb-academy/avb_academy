## Audio Data

In {{< tooltip "Milan">}}, audio data is transmitted via {{< tooltip "Streams" "Stream">}} using the Audio Video Transmission Protocol ({{< tooltip "AVTP">}}), which defines the structure of the data frames sent across the network.

The specification adopts the AVTP Audio Format (AAF) for audio transportâ€”not to be confused with the Advanced Authoring Format. It mandates that each {{< tooltip "PCM">}} sample be transmitted as a 32-bit value, with shorter samples zero-padded as needed.

A {{< tooltip "Talker">}} in a {{< tooltip "Milan">}} network defines the outgoing {{< tooltip "Stream">}} format, specifying the number of audio channels in the {{< tooltip "Stream">}}. The {{< tooltip "Listener">}} is required to adapt to the format provided by the {{< tooltip "Talker">}}.

The {{< tooltip "Milan">}} Base Format specifies support for channel counts of either 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 audio channels per {{< tooltip "Stream">}}. The support for the Base Format is mandatory for {{< tooltip "Listeners" "Listener">}} and part of the {{< tooltip "Milan">}} certification. This ensures interoperability between any {{< tooltip "Talker">}} and {{< tooltip "Listener">}}.

  <div class="text">
    <p>A {{< tooltip "Stream">}} can be viewed as a container for audio data. In addition to the audio content, it also includes Ethernet information, such as the source and destination {{< tooltip "MAC">}} addresses. Ethernet information is present in every packet. This mandatory overhead for each packet should make it evident that using a larger number of audio channels per {{< tooltip "Stream">}} is more efficient than using a smaller number.</p>

It is worth noting that a {{< tooltip "Stream">}} is configured with a fixed delay time before it starts streaming. The value range for delays is from 0.25ms to 2ms. Due to the fact that all devices in the network have a shared understanding of time, it is possible with {{< tooltip "Milan">}} to guarantee the latency that has been configured for the {{< tooltip "Stream">}}. Details on how this is possible are described in [Traffic Shaping Section](../03_traffic-shaping/_index.md).

## Media Clock Data

The previous section [Network Timing](../00_network-timing/_index.md) explains the distinction between {{< tooltip "Network Time">}} and {{< tooltip "Media Time">}} in {{< tooltip "Milan">}}.

In summary:

- **Network Time** is the shared global time base provided to all devices in the network by {{< tooltip "gPTP">}}.
- **Media Time** is the timing domain used specifically to synchronize audio recording and playback clocks in Endstations.

From a transport perspective, a {{< tooltip "Stream">}} can carry either Network Time synchronization data or Media Time clocking data.
