## Audio Data

In Milan, audio data is transmitted via {{< tooltip "Streams" "Stream">}} using the Audio Video Transmission Protocol (AVTP), which defines the structure of the data frames sent across the network.

The specification adopts the AVTP Audio Format (AAF) for audio transport. This is not to be confused with the Advanced Authoring Format. It mandates that each {{< tooltip "PCM">}} sample be transmitted as a 32-bit value, with shorter samples zero-padded as needed.

A {{< tooltip "Talker">}} in a Milan network defines the outgoing {{< tooltip "Stream">}} format, specifying the number of audio channels in the {{< tooltip "Stream">}}. The {{< tooltip "Listener">}} is required to adapt to the format provided by the {{< tooltip "Talker">}}.

The Milan Base Format specifies support for channel counts of either 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 audio channels per {{< tooltip "Stream">}}. The support for the Base Format is mandatory for {{< tooltip "Listeners" "Listener">}} and part of the Milan [certification](../../02_user-guides/certified-products.md). This ensures interoperability between any {{< tooltip "Talker">}} and {{< tooltip "Listener">}}.

  <div class="text">
    <p>A {{< tooltip "Stream">}} can be viewed as a container for audio data. In addition to the audio content, it also includes Ethernet information, such as the source and destination {{< tooltip "MAC">}} addresses. Ethernet information is present in every packet. This mandatory overhead for each packet should make it evident that using a larger number of audio channels per {{< tooltip "Stream">}} is more efficient than using a smaller number.</p>

It is worth noting that a {{< tooltip "Stream">}} is configured with a fixed {{< tooltip "PTO" >}} before it starts streaming. The value range for the PTO is from 0.25ms to 2ms. Due to the fact that all devices in the network have a shared understanding of time, it is possible with Milan to guarantee the latency that has been configured for the {{< tooltip "Stream">}}. Details on how this is possible are described in [Traffic Shaping Section](../03_traffic-shaping/_index.md).

## Media Clock Data

The previous section [Network Timing](../00_network-timing/_index.md) explains the distinction between {{< tooltip "Network Time">}} and {{< tooltip "Media Time">}} in Milan.

In summary:

- **Network Time** is the shared global time base provided to all devices in the network by {{< tooltip "gPTP">}}.
- **Media Time** is the timing domain used specifically to synchronize audio recording and playback clocks in Endstations.

From a transport perspective, a {{< tooltip "Stream">}} can carry either Network Time synchronization data or Media Time clocking data.
