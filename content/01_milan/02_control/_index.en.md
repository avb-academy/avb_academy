Milan AVB comes with a specification how to configure and monitor the devices. This is specified in the *AVB/TSN Discovery, Enumeration, Connection management, and Control* protocol (ATDECC).

The three main tasks are:

- **Device Discovery**: It defines mechanisms for discovering devices on a network, ensuring that devices can be identified and enumerated efficiently.
- **Connection Management**: This includes establishing, managing, and tearing down connections between devices on the network.
- **Control Protocol**: This part of the standard specifies how devices can be controlled and configured. This includes managing device settings, handling configurations, and ensuring that devices operate correctly within the network.

## Controllers

There are currently a couple of solutions available:
